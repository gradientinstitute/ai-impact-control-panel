# Server implementation

There are two components, a react-based frontend in the deva-ts folder (ts ==
typescript), and a flask server that deals with ajax queries from the frontend
that is actually running the elicitation.

## Starting up

1. go into the mlserver folder and run `./run.sh`
2. go into the deva-ts folder and run `yarn start`

The frontend should load in your browser.
