Major Components
================

The main output of this work is a software tool to assist AI system owners and
other stakeholders in selecting acceptable and realisable combinations of
quantitative performance metrics and qualitative factors for their system,
balancing the organisation's competing objectives in an ethical and accountable
way.

This 'governance tool' functions by asking a series of questions to the system
owner and stakeholders through a web interface. These questions may relate to
the relative importance of different objectives, the relative desirability of
different outcomes, and the relative importance of other qualitative factors of
a system. These questions are being selected by an elicitation algorithm, which
tries to characterise which realisable combinations of performance metrics and
other factors are acceptable to the user. The software tool is designed in a
modular way so that different elicitation algorithms can easily be added over
time.

We hypothesise that how the questions are presented to the user will have a big
impact on their decisions and on their ability to use the tool. Therefore we
intend to also create a modular system for visualisations of performance
comparisons. This will be, as much as possible, independent of the elicitation
system and communicate through well-defined Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs).   

To provide an environment for testing and exploration of different elicitation
algorithms and visualisations, we provide a 'scenario simulator' to generate
the inputs that would normally be obtained from the user organisation. This
tool is built around fraud detection in credit-card transactions, and simulates
data and models for this use case. The simulation is designed to be highly
configurable so as to allow us to explore different scenarios, (more or less
accurate models, noise levels, relationships between target variable and
demographics etc.). :numref:`fig_systemIO`, below, depicts the process of
using these tools and their specific inputs and outputs. We have also provided
a very simple job recommendation scenario that will work 'out of the box' -
with no generation necessary.

    Process diagram depicting the inputs and outputs of the org sim and
    governance tool. The first step is for the user organisation to collate the
    inputs required for the governance tool: these are a set of candidate model
    predictions, along with scores for their selected metrics, and additional
    specifications on the system's impacts. For exploratory development, the
    scenario simulator can be used to generate these inputs from a
    configuration file as a stand-in for a real organisation. The governance
    tool uses these inputs to elicit preferences about potential impacts from
    the system owner. At the end of this process the governance tool outputs a
    'region of acceptability' for a deployed AI system's metrics, a selected
    model, and a record of how these decisions were arrived at for
    accountability purposes.


The following sections provide more detail about the structure and function of
these two tools, and their sub-components.


Scenario Simulator
------------------

The scenario simulator generates inputs to the AI governance tool. Normally
these inputs would be provided by the user, but having an ability to generate
plausible but fictional data and models without a partner organisation will
help us develop and test the AI governance tool and do so for a wide range of
scenarios in future. 

The scenario simulator is currently based on a credit-card fraud transaction
use-case (detailed in :ref:`fraud_scen`). 

The simulator performs three functions: generating data from a statistical
model, training a series of AI models on that data from which the governance
tool will select, and 'scoring' these models by measuring their performance
against a defined set of metrics using held-out data. Each of these functions
is performed by a separate component in the code, outlined in
:numref:`fig_simulator` below.

Data Generator
..............

Function
~~~~~~~~

The data generator implements a statistical model that defines how the
different features in the data relate to each other, and generates random data
consistent with these relationships. The following simplified example
illustrates this process. 

The simulator might assume that incidence of fraud in a transaction is related
to the customer's income, which in turn depends on their gender. The data
generator would first, from a configuration file, determine the size of  a
hypothetical customer cohort. Each of these synthetic customers needs a gender
and an income, so it would first read the fraction of males in the cohort from
the configuration file, then randomly assign the synthetic customers' genders
based on this fraction. 

Next, the tool might assign each customer an income, assuming that these
incomes follow a power law distribution, but with a dependence on gender. The
configuration file specifies separate coefficients for males and females for
this power law, enabling the tool to randomly assign incomes accordingly.
Finally, for each customer a number of transactions is generated, which are
randomly assigned as fraudulent or not with a chance based on the customer's
income.

Arbitrarily large numbers of customers and transactions can be sampled in this
way, enabling the tool to generate training and testing datasets to be used by
the other components.

Inputs and outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The inputs to the data generator is a configuration file specifying the various
parameters of the simulation. The outputs of the data generator are tabular
data suitable for training and scoring models.

See :ref:`datasim` and :ref:`scripts` for detailed documentation.

Model Sampler
.............

Function
~~~~~~~~

The model sampler trains a configurable number of different predictive models on
the data generated by the data generator. The governance tool will help the
system owner select one of these models. The sampler tries to ensure that the
models have different performance characteristics by varying their
hyperparameters (parameters that control how the model learns from data).
Hyperparameters from each model are drawn from lists and ranges specified in the
scenario configuration file.  


Inputs and outputs 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The inputs to the model sampler are training and testing data (features and
targets) from the data generator, and hyperparameter ranges in a configuration
file. The outputs of the model sampler are predictions made on the testing
data. 

See :ref:`model` and :ref:`scripts` for detailed documentation.


Model Scorer
............

Function
~~~~~~~~

The model scorer assesses the performance of the generated models using metrics
provided by the user in the scenario configuration. These metrics are
quantifiable representations of concepts that the user believes are important
characteristics of the system. 

For example, when detecting fraud, the user will likely care about the rate at
which the system correctly flags fraudulent transactions. This concern can be
captured by providing the model scorer with the true positive rate (or
sensitivity) as a metric to evaluate the system against.

Similarly, the user may worry about the system targeting certain individuals
with a disproportionate number of erroneous fraud labels. The distribution of
the system's areas across the population can be captured using a metric like the
Gini coefficient.

Inputs and outputs 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The model scorer ingests models and metrics provided by the user. It assesses
the modelsâ€™ performances using these metrics and returns the resulting scores to
the user and/or as input to the governance tool.

See :ref:`model`, :ref:`score` and :ref:`scripts` for more information.



.. _fraud_scen:

Fraud Scenario
..............

For the purposes of developing and testing the governance tool, Gradient
constructed a hypothetical use-case around automated fraud detection. In this
scenario, a bank is deploying an AI system to automatically detect fraud within
a stream of credit card transactions. Individual transactions are assessed in
terms of their amount, vendor type, features of the card's recent transactions
and features of the customer. The AI system then predicts whether a given
transaction is expected to be fraudulent. The system will automatically block
any card that is flagged as a fraudulent transaction, but the customer may then
choose to unblock the card if they confirm with the bank that the transaction
was legitimate, or report a fraud if the system has missed it.

As with any AI system, careful and ongoing analysis to check for risks of
unintentional harm or discrimination is vital in this scenario. AI systems can
inadvertently advantage or disadvantage some groups or individuals compared to
others. Inequality could arise, for example, if the system was more accurate at
detecting fraud for some groups or individuals than others. There might also be
fairness concerns if the base rate of fraud was higher for some groups or
individuals than others. We frame the implications of these problems in terms of
system impacts below. 

Detailed scenario descriptions and metrics can be found in the scenario metadata
files, :ref:`fraud`.

Impacts: Errors in Prediction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fraud detection system incurs two types of errors - false negatives and
false positives.

**False negatives**

A false negative occurs when the system fails to notice and prevent a fraudulent
transaction. These errors are typically identified after some delay, when the
customer receives their monthly account summary. 

From the bank's perspective, a false negative typically results in a financial
loss  as the bank is required to compensate the customer while rarely being able
to recoup this loss from the fraudster. 

From the customer's perspective, false negatives are, at best, an inconvenience
because of the time and effort required to notify the bank of their systemâ€™s
mistake. At worst, the fraudulent transactions may also go unnoticed by the
customer resulting in a financial loss for them.

**False positives**

A false positive occurs when the system incorrectly flags a legitimate
transaction as fraudulent. This requires the customer to inform the bank that a
mistake was made by the detection system before the transaction can proceed. 

In some cases, the customer may simply use a credit card from a different
provider resulting in a loss of transaction revenue for the bank. A customer
subjected to repeated errors may be inconvenienced enough to decide to
permanently switch financial institutions, resulting in a financial loss for the
bank.

Impacts: Responsible AI considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Customer wellbeing**

Given that false positives and false negatives are both harmful to customers, a
clear ethical objective of the system is to minimise both error types - the idea
being that a system that makes fewer errors is less harmful. Obviously the
system should be optimised as much as possible given the data available, but it
is expected that even an optimised system will make some errors. It will then be
necessary to decide how to tune the system to balance false positives against
false negatives.  While this optimisation and balancing closely relates to
business objectives, determining whether a given system performance is
acceptable, and what the desired  balance between different types of errors
requires explicit consideration of business and customer impact because the
harms to the customers and the costs to the bank are different.

**Individual fairness**

Regardless of how many errors the system makes, individual fairness relates to
whether a small fraction of individuals bear a disproportionate fraction of the
total system errors. Even if a system is accurate overall, a few individuals may
still  experience a disproportionately high error rate. For example, a
customer's circumstances might require them to conduct legitimate transactions
with features that resemble fraudulent transactions. We typically examine such
impacts by measuring how evenly dispersed the system's errors are, or by
examining the peak number of errors that the worst off individuals experience.

**Group fairness**

Fraud systems leverage information from a wide range of sources when determining
whether to flag each transaction as fraudulent or not. Some of this information
relates directly to the customer and often correlates strongly with demographic
features. For example, even if a system does not directly use gender in its
decision making, male and female spending patterns are expected to be different.
Group fairness relates to whether some demographic groups experience more harm
than others (on average).


AI Governance Tool
------------------

The AI governance tool helps system owners select acceptable and realisable
combinations of performance metrics for their AI systems. Given a set of
candidate models and their performance metrics, the tool interacts with a
system owner through a visual user interface to elicit the system owner's
preferences. The elicits a system owners preferences for two tasks:

1. An AI system's performance may drift over time, or it may be known before a
   system is deployed that there are minimum performance expectations. For
   these reasons it is important to establish a region of minimum acceptable
   performance for an AI system. We refer to this as `boundary elicitation`.
2. Choosing a AI system for final deployment from a set of candidate systems
   (or the same AI system with difference settings). We refer to this as
   `deployment elicitation`.

    Internal structure of the AI governance tool. The 'vis' and 'method' modules
    are designed to be independent, and to support addition of new
    visualisations and elicitation methods being added over time through a
    well-defined API.

The design of the governance tool has been divided into a series of discrete
components:

* an elicitation engine, which decides which model comparisons to present to the
  user, and how to interpret their answers
* a visualisation engine, which displays model comparisons in an ethically
  meaningful way
* a user interface, that interacts with the user by showing them visualisations
  and obtaining their input
* a configuration manager, which provides the required detail about the problem
  context to the other components.

The elicitation and visualisation engines are intended to be based on
'plug-ins': independent blocks of code that provide a particular method of
elicitation or a particular style of visualisation that can be added over time
and used independently. This is both to help us perform experiments quickly as
we develop the code, and also to make it more extensible by others in the
future.

More detail about the functioning of each of these components is provided in the
following subsections.


Visualisation Engine
....................

The visualisation engine presents comparisons of the system performance metrics
to the user in an intuitive and easy to understand visual format. It will use
specialised modules to explain particular metrics in terms of harms and benefits
and how they are distributed. This is both to ensure that the user understands
the performance of the system, and to enable comparisons between two candidate
systems (or one candidate system and a baseline) in terms of multiple system
metrics for the purposes of preference elicitation. The visualisation engine
plugs in a set of relevant visualisation modules (selected from an extensible
library of supported metrics).


Inputs and outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The inputs of the visualisation engine are selected comparisons of candidate
  models from the elicitation engine, the relevant performance metrics for those
  models, and additional scenario context from a configuration file.  
* The outputs of the visualisation engine are visual representations of model
  comparisons that are presented in the user interface.


Implementation status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a current focus of our development. We are drawing from our own
experience in the fraud use-case specifically, and intend to iterate closely
with the project collaborators and our UX team member to develop
easy-to-understand visualisations specific to the collaborator's use-case.

We continue to develop generic visualisations that can be customised
with configuration files, to assist users that cannot develop their own
visualisations specific to their use-case. 


User Interface
..............

Function
~~~~~~~~

The user interface displays the comparison visualisations to the user and
obtains their input to send to the elicitation engine. This interface will be
web-based to enable usage of the governance tool in the cloud.


Inputs and outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The inputs to the user interface will be the comparison visualisations to
  display to the user from the visualisation engine, the selections provided by
  the user, as well as any additional parameters from a configuration file. 
* The outputs of the user interface will be the selections provided by the user
  which will be sent to the elicitation engine. 


Implementation status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have a prototype interface that summarises the scenario from a configurable
scenario metadata file. This interface then allows the use to choose between
boundary and deployment elicitation, and then proceeds with the elicitation
process. We are currently refining the design and flow of this interface with a
UX specialist.


Elicitation Engines
...................


Function
~~~~~~~~

The system owner responsible for balancing a system's objectives will often be
addressing many requirements and objectives simultaneously. A preference
elicitation engine is a tool to help these people understand and balance the
trade-offs that exist between the different performance aspects of a system
(such as how to balance a system's fairness against profitability). 

There is no objectively correct solution to such decisions: the answer depends
on the values and priorities of the system owner and the organisation they
represent. A preference elicitation algorithm breaks the nebulous question of
'what do you want?' into manageable steps by iteratively asking the user to
state a preference between specific combinations of impacts. The choices
presented to the user are strategically designed to discover their preference,
typically by asking about new combinations of metrics, or refining the tipping
point at which a quantity of one metric balances out a different quantity of
another.

Furthermore, there may be qualitative aspects of a system that are important in
this choice. For example, it may be the case that an AI system that has a
human-in-the-loop component is more desirable that a system without. These
quantitative 'metrics' should also be considered in the elicitation process.

There is no 'best' approach for preference elicitation: different approaches
will work well for different users and in different contexts. Hence, we have
designed the elicitation engine to accept different elicitation algorithms in
the form of interchangeable plug-ins, communicating with a common API. 

The elicitation engine has two specific sub-functions:

* **Boundary elicitation**. Elicit from the system owner and stake holders what
  the acceptable operating limits are for the system. If the AI system fails to
  meet these limits, then either a fallback (reference) system should be
  engaged, or the system should cease operation.
* **Deployment elicitation**. Elicit from the system owner and stake holders
  which system should be chosen for deployment, based on it's measured
  outcomes, from a set of candidate systems.


Inputs and outputs - Boundary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The inputs to the boundary elicitation model are performance metrics for a
reference (fallback) system; this may be a system (AI or not) that is currently
in deployment, a hypothetical system or no system; and a set constraints or
hard boundaries on performance metrics that are known a-priori.

The outputs of the boundary elicitation engine are: 

* rounds of strategic choices presented to the user. These will be of the form
  of asking of a generated system is preferable to the reference system
  provided.
* (after multiple iterations of choices) a set of requirements on the system
  performance before the reference system must be fallen back to.
* a descriptive record of the decision-process and the preferences provided by
  the system owner for accountability purposes.


Inputs and outputs - Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The inputs of the deployment elicitation engine are performance metrics for
each candidate model, a set of performance constraints is applicable, and
additional scenario configuration parameters in a configuration file. 

The outputs of the deployment elicitation engine are: 

* rounds of strategic choices that are presented to the user. These will
  typically be in the form of comparisons between two candidate systems (or one
  candidate and a baseline), where the capability of the visualisation engine
  will be invoked to present the relevant information. The outcomes presented
  might correspond to real systems, or to hypothetical systems.
* a candidate model that is preferred above all others for deployment.
* a descriptive record of the decision-process and the preferences provided by
  the system owner for accountability purposes.


Implementation Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We currently have a pre-production prototype for the boundary elicitation
engine. After feedback from the project advisors, we have to modify this
prototype before incorporating it into the software tool.

The deployment elicitation engine has been implemented with multiple selectable
elicitation algorithms.
