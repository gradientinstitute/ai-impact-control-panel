## Installation

1. Install python-poetry
2. run `poetry install` in this directory

Note: there is no need to do a pip install -e . : this happens automatically, 
along with venv creation and dependencies.

To get into a venv, do `poetry shell`.

## Running

Currently just a skeleton, but try:

`deva-dash`

## Testing

In the venv, run `pytest`.
